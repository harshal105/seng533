# Comprehensive Review of MongoDB Performance

## 📘 Overview
MongoDB is a widely-used NoSQL database known for its scalability, flexibility, and support for modern application development.  
This project conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation of MongoDB under varying conditions, focusing on:

- **Data Types**
- **Workload Size**
- **Concurrency**
- **Schema Complexity**

## 📊 Performance Analysis
The analysis is conducted using four Python scripts, each targeting one of the test variables. The following performance metrics are tracked:

- 🔁 **Internal Requests**
- 📥 **Network In**
- 📤 **Network Out**
- ⏱️ **Latency**
- 📈 **Processed Throughput**

---

## 🔧 Test Variables

### 📦 Workload Size
Three data volumes are used to test scalability:

- `100,000` entries  
- `500,000` entries  
- `1,000,000` entries

### 🧾 Data Types
Two data-type configurations are tested:

- All fields as **strings**
- A mix of **strings**, **integers**, and **arrays**

### 🏗️ Schema Types
Three schema structures of increasing complexity:

1. **Flat schema**
2. **Moderately nested schema**
3. **Complex nested schema**

### 🧵 Concurrency
Tests simulate concurrent operations using:

- `1` thread  
- `2` threads  
- `5` threads
